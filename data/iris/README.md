# Irises Data Set

One of the most famous datasets in machine learning, the Iris dataset contains 150 samples from three species of iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Primarely used for classification tasks, the Iris dataset is often used as a beginner's dataset for machine learning and data visualization. We can also use it for cluster analysis, as it contains three distinct clusters corresponding to the three species of iris flowers. In addition we can use it for dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or t-SNE to visualize the data in lower dimensions.
